Jobs will be aborted if the total size is above this limit. Having a high limit may cause out-of-memory errors in driver (depends on spark.driver.memory and memory overhead of objects in JVM). Setting a proper limit can protect the driver from out-of-memory errors."
spark.driver.memory,1g,"Amount of memory to use for the driver process, i.e. where SparkContext is initialized, in the same format as JVM memory strings with a size unit suffix (""k"", ""m"", ""g"" or ""t"") (e.g. 512m, 2g).

spark.executor.pyspark.memory,Not set,"The amount of memory to be allocated to PySpark in each executor, in MiB unless otherwise specified. If set, PySpark memory for an executor will be limited to this amount. If not set, Spark will not limit Python's memory use and it is up to the application to avoid exceeding the overhead memory space shared with other non-JVM processes. When PySpark is run in YARN or Kubernetes, this memory is added to executor resource requests."

spark.pyspark.python,,Python binary executable to use for PySpark in both driver and executors.
spark.reducer.maxSizeInFlight,48m,"Maximum size of map outputs to fetch simultaneously from each reduce task, in MiB unless otherwise specified. Since each output requires us to create a buffer to receive it, this represents a fixed memory overhead per reduce task, so keep it small unless you have a large amount of memory."
spark.reducer.maxReqsInFlight,Int.MaxValue,"This configuration limits the number of remote requests to fetch blocks at any given point. When the number of hosts in the cluster increase, it might lead to very large number of inbound connections to one or more nodes, causing the workers to fail under load. By allowing it to limit the number of fetch requests, this scenario can be mitigated."
spark.reducer.maxBlocksInFlightPerAddress,Int.MaxValue,"This configuration limits the number of remote blocks being fetched per reduce task from a given host port. When a large number of blocks are being requested from a given address in a single fetch or simultaneously, this could crash the serving executor or Node Manager. This is especially useful to reduce the load on the Node Manager when external shuffle is enabled. You can mitigate this issue by setting it to a lower value."
spark.maxRemoteBlockSizeFetchToMem,Int.MaxValue - 512,"The remote block will be fetched to disk when size of the block is above this threshold in bytes. This is to avoid a giant request that takes too much memory. By default, this is only enabled for blocks > 2GB, as those cannot be fetched directly into memory, no matter what resources are available. But it can be turned down to a much lower value (eg. 200m) to avoid using too much memory on smaller blocks as well. Note this configuration will affect both shuffle fetch and block manager remote block fetch. For users who enabled external shuffle service, this feature can only be used when external shuffle service is newer than Spark 2.2."
spark.shuffle.compress,true,Whether to compress map output files. Generally a good idea. Compression will use spark.io.compression.codec.
spark.shuffle.file.buffer,32k,"Size of the in-memory buffer for each shuffle file output stream, in KiB unless otherwise specified. These buffers reduce the number of disk seeks and system calls made in creating intermediate shuffle files."
spark.shuffle.io.maxRetries,3,(Netty only) Fetches that fail due to IO-related exceptions are automatically retried if this is set to a non-zero value. This retry logic helps stabilize large shuffles in the face of long GC pauses or transient network connectivity issues.
spark.shuffle.io.numConnectionsPerPeer,1,"(Netty only) Connections between hosts are reused in order to reduce connection buildup for large clusters. For clusters with many hard disks and few hosts, this may result in insufficient concurrency to saturate all disks, and so users may consider increasing this value."
spark.shuffle.io.preferDirectBufs,true,"(Netty only) Off-heap buffers are used to reduce garbage collection during shuffle and cache block transfer. For environments where off-heap memory is tightly limited, users may wish to turn this off to force all allocations from Netty to be on-heap."

spark.shuffle.maxChunksBeingTransferred,Long.MAX_VALUE,"The max number of chunks allowed to be transferred at the same time on shuffle service. Note that new incoming connections will be closed when the max number is hit. The client will retry according to the shuffle retry configs (see spark.shuffle.io.maxRetries and spark.shuffle.io.retryWait), if those limits are reached the task will fail with fetch failure."
spark.shuffle.sort.bypassMergeThreshold,200,"(Advanced) In the sort-based shuffle manager, avoid merge-sorting data if there is no map-side aggregation and there are at most this many reduce partitions."
spark.shuffle.spill.compress,true,Whether to compress data spilled during shuffles. Compression will use spark.io.compression.codec.
spark.shuffle.accurateBlockThreshold,100 * 1024 * 1024,Threshold in bytes above which the size of shuffle blocks in HighlyCompressedMapStatus is accurately recorded. This helps to prevent OOM by avoiding underestimating shuffle block size when fetch shuffle blocks.

spark.eventLog.longForm.enabled,false,"If true, use the long form of call sites in the event log. Otherwise use the short form."
spark.eventLog.compress,false,"Whether to compress logged events, if spark.eventLog.enabled is true. Compression will use spark.io.compression.codec."
spark.eventLog.dir,file:///tmp/spark-events,"Base directory in which Spark events are logged, if spark.eventLog.enabled is true. Within this base directory, Spark creates a sub-directory for each application, and logs the events specific to the application in this directory. Users may want to set this to a unified location like an HDFS directory so history files can be read by the history server."
spark.eventLog.enabled,false,"Whether to log Spark events, useful for reconstructing the Web UI after the application has finished."
spark.eventLog.overwrite,false,Whether to overwrite any existing files.

spark.ui.reverseProxy,false,"Enable running Spark Master as reverse proxy for worker and application UIs. In this mode, Spark master will reverse proxy the worker and application UIs to enable access without requiring direct access to their hosts. Use it with caution, as worker and application UI will not be accessible directly, you will only be able to access them through spark master/proxy public URL. This setting affects all the workers and application UIs running in the cluster and must be set on all the workers, drivers and masters."
spark.ui.reverseProxyUrl,,This is the URL where your proxy is running. This URL is for proxy which is running in front of Spark Master. This is useful when running proxy for authentication e.g. OAuth proxy. Make sure this is a complete URL including scheme (http/https) and port to reach your proxy.
spark.ui.showConsoleProgress,true,"Show the progress bar in the console. The progress bar shows the progress of stages that run for longer than 500ms. If multiple stages run at the same time, multiple progress bars will be displayed on the same line."

spark.com.test.filter1.param.name1=foo 
spark.com.test.filter1.param.name2=bar"
spark.broadcast.compress,true,Whether to compress broadcast variables before sending them. Generally a good idea. Compression will use spark.io.compression.codec.
spark.io.compression.codec,lz4,"The codec used to compress internal data such as RDD partitions, event log, broadcast variables and shuffle outputs. By default, Spark provides four codecs: lz4, lzf, snappy, and zstd. You can also use fully qualified class names to specify the codec, e.g. org.apache.spark.io.LZ4CompressionCodec, org.apache.spark.io.LZFCompressionCodec, org.apache.spark.io.SnappyCompressionCodec, and org.apache.spark.io.ZStdCompressionCodec."
spark.io.compression.lz4.blockSize,32k,"Block size in bytes used in LZ4 compression, in the case when LZ4 compression codec is used. Lowering this block size will also lower shuffle memory usage when LZ4 is used."
spark.io.compression.snappy.blockSize,32k,"Block size in bytes used in Snappy compression, in the case when Snappy compression codec is used. Lowering this block size will also lower shuffle memory usage when Snappy is used."

spark.kryo.referenceTracking,true,"Whether to track references to the same object when serializing data with Kryo, which is necessary if your object graphs have loops and useful for efficiency if they contain multiple copies of the same object. Can be disabled to improve performance if you know this is not the case."
spark.kryo.registrationRequired,false,"Whether to require registration with Kryo. If set to 'true', Kryo will throw an exception if an unregistered class is serialized. If set to false (the default), Kryo will write unregistered class names along with each object. Writing class names can cause significant performance overhead, so enabling this option can enforce strictly that a user has not omitted classes from registration."
spark.kryo.registrator,(none),"If you use Kryo serialization, give a comma-separated list of classes that register your custom classes with Kryo. This property is useful if you need to register your classes in a custom way, e.g. to specify a custom field serializer. Otherwise spark.kryo.classesToRegister is simpler. It should be set to classes that extend KryoRegistrator. See the tuning guide for more details."

spark.rdd.compress,false,Whether to compress serialized RDD partitions (e.g. for StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY_SER in Java and Scala or StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY in Python). Can save substantial space at the cost of some extra CPU time. Compression will use spark.io.compression.codec.
spark.serializer,"org.apache.spark.serializer.
JavaSerializer","Class to use for serializing objects that will be sent over the network or need to be cached in serialized form. The default of Java serialization works with any Serializable Java object but is quite slow, so we recommend using org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer and configuring Kryo serialization when speed is necessary. Can be any subclass of org.apache.spark.Serializer."
spark.serializer.objectStreamReset,100,"When serializing using org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaSerializer, the serializer caches objects to prevent writing redundant data, however that stops garbage collection of those objects. By calling 'reset' you flush that info from the serializer, and allow old objects to be collected. To turn off this periodic reset set it to -1. By default it will reset the serializer every 100 objects."
spark.memory.fraction,0.6,"Fraction of (heap space - 300MB) used for execution and storage. The lower this is, the more frequently spills and cached data eviction occur. The purpose of this config is to set aside memory for internal metadata, user data structures, and imprecise size estimation in the case of sparse, unusually large records. Leaving this at the default value is recommended. For more detail, including important information about correctly tuning JVM garbage collection when increasing this value, see this description."
spark.memory.storageFraction,0.5,"Amount of storage memory immune to eviction, expressed as a fraction of the size of the region set aside by spark.memory.fraction.

spark.memory.offHeap.size,0,"The absolute amount of memory in bytes which can be used for off-heap allocation. This setting has no impact on heap memory usage, so if your executors' total memory consumption must fit within some hard limit then be sure to shrink your JVM heap size accordingly. This must be set to a positive value when spark.memory.offHeap.enabled=true."
spark.memory.useLegacyMode,false,"Whether to enable the legacy memory management mode used in Spark 1.5 and before. The legacy mode rigidly partitions the heap space into fixed-size regions, potentially leading to excessive spilling if the application was not tuned. The following deprecated memory fraction configurations are not read unless this is enabled: spark.shuffle.memoryFraction
 spark.storage.memoryFraction
 spark.storage.unrollFraction"
spark.shuffle.memoryFraction,0.2,"(deprecated) This is read only if spark.memory.useLegacyMode is enabled. Fraction of Java heap to use for aggregation and cogroups during shuffles. At any given time, the collective size of all in-memory maps used for shuffles is bounded by this limit, beyond which the contents will begin to spill to disk. If spills are often, consider increasing this value at the expense of spark.storage.memoryFraction."
spark.storage.memoryFraction,0.6,"(deprecated) This is read only if spark.memory.useLegacyMode is enabled. Fraction of Java heap to use for Spark's memory cache.

spark.storage.unrollFraction,0.2,(deprecated) This is read only if spark.memory.useLegacyMode is enabled. Fraction of spark.storage.memoryFraction to use for unrolling blocks in memory. This is dynamically allocated by dropping existing blocks when there is not enough free storage space to unroll the new block in its entirety.
spark.storage.replication.proactive,false,Enables proactive block replication for RDD blocks. Cached RDD block replicas lost due to executor failures are replenished if there are any existing available replicas. This tries to get the replication level of the block to the initial number.
spark.cleaner.periodicGC.interval,30min,"Controls how often to trigger a garbage collection.

 This context cleaner triggers cleanups only when weak references are garbage collected. In long-running applications with large driver JVMs, where there is little memory pressure on the driver, this may happen very occasionally or not at all. Not cleaning at all may lead to executors running out of disk space after a while."

spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.cleanCheckpoints,false,Controls whether to clean checkpoint files if the reference is out of scope.
spark.broadcast.blockSize,4m,"Size of each piece of a block for TorrentBroadcastFactory, in KiB unless otherwise specified. Too large a value decreases parallelism during broadcast (makes it slower); however, if it is too small, BlockManager might take a performance hit."
spark.broadcast.checksum,true,"Whether to enable checksum for broadcast. If enabled, broadcasts will include a checksum, which can help detect corrupted blocks, at the cost of computing and sending a little more data.

Mesos fine grained mode: 8 
Others: total number of cores on all executor nodes or 2, whichever is larger","Default number of partitions in RDDs returned by transformations like join, reduceByKey, and parallelize when not set by user."
spark.executor.heartbeatInterval,10s,Interval between each executor's heartbeats to the driver. Heartbeats let the driver know that the executor is still alive and update it with metrics for in-progress tasks. spark.executor.heartbeatInterval should be significantly less than spark.network.timeout
spark.files.fetchTimeout,60s,Communication timeout to use when fetching files added through SparkContext.addFile() from the driver.
spark.files.useFetchCache,true,"If set to true (default), file fetching will use a local cache that is shared by executors that belong to the same application, which can improve task launching performance when running many executors on the same host.

spark.hadoop.validateOutputSpecs,true,"If set to true, validates the output specification (e.g. checking if the output directory already exists) used in saveAsHadoopFile and other variants. This can be disabled to silence exceptions due to pre-existing output directories. We recommend that users do not disable this except if trying to achieve compatibility with previous versions of Spark. Simply use Hadoop's FileSystem API to delete output directories by hand. This setting is ignored for jobs generated through Spark Streaming's StreamingContext, since data may need to be rewritten to pre-existing output directories during checkpoint recovery."
spark.storage.memoryMapThreshold,2m,"Size in bytes of a block above which Spark memory maps when reading a block from disk. This prevents Spark from memory mapping very small blocks. In general, memory mapping has high overhead for blocks close to or below the page size of the operating system."

spark.task.reaper.enabled,false,"Enables monitoring of killed / interrupted tasks. When set to true, any task which is killed will be monitored by the executor until that task actually finishes executing. See the other spark.task.reaper.* configurations for details on how to control the exact behavior of this monitoring.

spark.dynamicAllocation.executorAllocationRatio,1,"By default, the dynamic allocation will request enough executors to maximize the parallelism according to the number of tasks to process. While this minimizes the latency of the job, with small tasks this setting can waste a lot of resources due to executor allocation overhead, as some executor might not even do any work. This setting allows to set a ratio that will be used to reduce the number of executors w.r.t. full parallelism.

spark.yarn.historyServer.address,(none),"The address of the Spark history server, e.g. host.com:18080. The address should not contain a scheme (http://). Defaults to not being set since the history server is an optional service. This address is given to the YARN ResourceManager when the Spark application finishes to link the application from the ResourceManager UI to the Spark history server UI. For this property, YARN properties can be used as variables, and these are substituted by Spark at runtime.

spark.yarn.jars,(none),"List of libraries containing Spark code to distribute to YARN containers. By default, Spark on YARN will use Spark jars installed locally, but the Spark jars can also be in a world-readable location on HDFS. This allows YARN to cache it on nodes so that it doesn't need to be distributed each time an application runs. To point to jars on HDFS, for example, set this configuration to hdfs:///some/path. Globs are allowed."
spark.yarn.archive,(none),"An archive containing needed Spark jars for distribution to the YARN cache. If set, this configuration replaces spark.yarn.jars and the archive is used in all the application's containers. The archive should contain jar files in its root directory. Like with the previous option, the archive can also be hosted on HDFS to speed up file distribution."

Coupled with spark.yarn.config.replacementPath, this is used to support clusters with heterogeneous configurations, so that Spark can correctly launch remote processes. The replacement path normally will contain a reference to some environment variable exported by YARN (and, thus, visible to Spark containers). For example, if the gateway node has Hadoop libraries installed on /disk1/hadoop, and the location of the Hadoop install is exported by YARN as the HADOOP_HOME environment variable, setting this value to /disk1/hadoop and the replacement path to $HADOOP_HOME will make sure that paths used to launch remote processes properly reference the local YARN configuration."

This will be used with YARN's rolling log aggregation, to enable this feature in YARN side yarn.nodemanager.log-aggregation.roll-monitoring-interval-seconds should be configured in yarn-site.xml. This feature can only be used with Hadoop 2.6.4+. The Spark log4j appender needs be changed to use FileAppender or another appender that can handle the files being removed while it is running.

For example, spark.yarn.access.hadoopFileSystems=hdfs://nn1.com:8032,hdfs://nn2.com:8032, webhdfs://nn3.com:50070. The Spark application must have access to the filesystems listed and Kerberos must be properly configured to be able to access them (either in the same realm or in a trusted realm). Spark acquires security tokens for each of the filesystems so that the Spark application can access those remote Hadoop filesystems."
